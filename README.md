# hybridlabel
Hybrid labeling(HYBRID) is our original labeling technique for shortest-path and distance queries on a variety of graphs. HYBRID captures characteristics from several existing state-of-the-art techniques such as CH, PLL and HopDoubling and it provides with a controllable performance tuning which can efficiently trade off between fast query and  low space consumption.
